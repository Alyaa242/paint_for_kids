# Paint for Kids :art:

**A fancy colorful application is an effective way to teach kids some computer skills!**

Educational games are another enjoyable way for kids teaching. Paint for Kids is a simple application that enables kids draw fancy shapes and also play some 
simple games with those shapes. It helps a kid draw a number of figures, fill them with different colors, save and load a graph, and so on. The application should provide a game playing mode to teach kids how to differentiate between figures’ types and colors.
